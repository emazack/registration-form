## Overview - Run the App

You can visit the online page (link below) or follow the instruction to run it locally:
1) Install Node and npm
2) Download or git clone the project source code from https://github.com/emazack/user-manager
3) Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
4) Start the application by running npm start from the command line in the project root folder, this will launch a browser displaying the application.

This app include some pages. A basic index page where you can reach the add form and the manage page where you can have a look to the users
Here you can edit or delete a record. The app is responsive and it is online on Github pages. There is a fake backend taken from https://gorest.co.in

The online page can give some unexpected 404 error page. The issue is that GitHub Pages doesn't support single page apps, so there is a 404 error when refreshing page. Check this out https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages

## My process

This is a project done in React. I used github as a versioning system to keep track of my progress. The project was developed entirely with the use of the English language. I started by studying the API to contact; I started with a GET and a POST of the data, then I decided to complete the project by inserting the DELETE and EDIT. I felt it was important to have a responsive layout and major error handling. Later I focused on bug fixes and general optimization. The structure of the project is basic and provides excellent ideas for future engineering.

### Built with

- React
- Css
- Bootstrap
- Github Pages
- Axios
- Responsive layout

### Continued development

I find interesting optimizing the design and component structure in the future. It might be a good idea to separate functions from presentation logic by creating separate spaces for services and functions that are used from components. It might also be a good idea to limit some repetition of jsx code, by creating centralized components for adding and editing records.
